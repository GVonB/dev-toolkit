## Development & Coding  

| Tool | Description | Link |  
|------|------------|------|  
| Insomnia | A robust REST API client with a clean UI. Useful for in-depth API testing and development. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://example.com) |  
| Postman (VS Code Extension) | An alternative to Insomnia in most cases, I use the Postman extension for quick and simple API testing inside VS Code. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Postman.postman-for-vscode) |
| iTerm2 | My old terminal of choice for MacOS. With profiles, keybinds, and huge community support, the lack of cross-platform support is the only real downside. If Warp's required login system and closed-source nature is a deal-breaker, this is my go-to recommendation. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://iterm2.com/) |
| Visual Studio Code | A modular, customizable, and cross-platform text editor. The suite of third-party tools and extensions available let you customize your environment to your liking, in a much simpler manner than terminal tools like Vim. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |
| Warp | My current terminal of choice. Its clean aesthetic, autocompletion, and cross-platform remote configuration syncing keep me coming back. With so many QoL features, everything in Warp just works, keeping me in flow. However, it is closed-source and requires a login–potential deal-breakers for some. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://www.warp.dev/) |

## Productivity & Workflow  

| Tool | Description | Link |  
|------|------------|------|  
| Microsoft PowerToys | A life-saving suite of productivity modules that greatly enhance the feel of Windows. FancyZones, Color Picker, Always on Top, Peek, and PowerToys Run are my most used, with the last two providing the easiest Windows equivalent to their MacOS counterparts. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/) |
| Raycast | A direct upgrade to the default Spotlight Search on MacOS, this tool allows me to quickly perform a huge variety of tasks including calculations/conversions, file searches, and specific application functions through various extensions. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://www.raycast.com/) |
| Rectangle | A simple, free, and open-source window management tool for MacOS. Rectangle adds the option to use keybinds to move and tile windows, with the option to specify window margins as well. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://rectangleapp.com/) |
| Swish | Another window management tool–specifically meant for MacOS trackpads. This program allows simple motions to perform all kinds of actions. I use Swish to move, tile, minimize/maximize, and close programs in conjuction with Rectangle for when I'm already using a keyboard. The default grid spacing on Swish seems to best match with 9px in Rectangle. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://rectangleapp.com/) |
| Todo+ (VS Code Extension) | A simple VSCode extension that allows .todo files to feature checkboxes, timers, and colored styling. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabiospampinato.vscode-todo-plus) |

## Miscellaneous  

| Tool | Description | Link |  
|------|------------|------|  
| Everything | A filesystem indexing tool that allows you to search your entire system. With instant search results as you type, regex support, and low resource usage, this tool speeds up all kinds of file searches compared to Windows' File Explorer. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://www.voidtools.com/) |
| Wallpaper Engine | A fun way to liven up any Windows desktop, especially nice when combined with a tiling window manager that leaves margins between windows. | [🔗&nbsp;Website](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) |
